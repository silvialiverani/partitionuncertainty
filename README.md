# Code for computing partition uncertainty

Authors: Aurore Lavigne and Silvia Liverani

This repository provides the functions that can be used alongside the R package PReMiuM to compute the partition uncertainty as proposed in Lavigne and Liverani (2022) "Quantifying the uncertainty of partitions for infinite mixture models".
